# Rectangle-DVD-Screen
A simple rectangle bouncing around the screen like the DVD logo!

This is a very simple program I made, only consisting of around 100 lines of code and one .py file. It uses very simple pygame functions to make a rectangle bounce around the screen, like how the DVD logo bounces around on screens. You can change the height or width of the window, rectangle, or adjust the speed as you like using properly named variables. I decided to upload this to here simply for fun, so thanks for checking it out!
